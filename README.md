# YOLO Object Detection with OpenCV and Python

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLO ("You Only Look Once") deep learning algorithm implemented in OpenCV. It detects objects in live webcam feed and draws bounding boxes with class labels.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- (Optional) CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
